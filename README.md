# 👨‍💻 Junot Fras | Web Developer Portfolio

The central hub for my web development projects. This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, serving as a gateway to my applications and technical case studies.

## 🚀 About This Project

This portfolio was designed to be a lightweight, high-performance landing page. Unlike heavy framework-based portfolios, this is built with **Semantic HTML5** and **Modern CSS3**, ensuring it loads instantly on any device and achieves a 100/100 Lighthouse performance score.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **CSS Grid & Flexbox:** For a responsive, tile-based layout that adapts from mobile to desktop.
* **CSS Variables:** To manage the color system and enable the Dark/Light mode theme toggle.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For DOM manipulation (theme switching) without external dependencies.
* **Semantic HTML:** Accessible structure (nav, main, section, footer) for better SEO and screen reader support.
